# A-Cellular-Model-for-Road-Traffic

An analysis of traffic flow within single and double lane systems using a discrete automation model. Road density dependant optimum speed limits are successfully estimated for these circular road systems of 22mph to 56mph. The improvement in flow when going from the single to double lane models
was also inspected and found to be a factor of 1.92 to 1.65 greater, dependant on road speed limit. Finally, a ’funnelling lane’ style model was then explored which was seen to have an equilibrium density which changed with speed limit. Within this file:

'Theory_Project.pdf': Report written following investigation. This includes an introduction to the cellular automata model used during the study, the theory and definitions behind traffic flow, an explanation of the various models used during the study and a full discussion of the results with references to conclude. 

'Theory_project.ipynb': Jupyter notebook used with all Python code used during the simulation. Note this is a working document and so includes all the various studies completed with code to process and visualise data.
