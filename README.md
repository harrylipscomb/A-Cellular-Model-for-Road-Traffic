# A-Cellular-Model-for-Road-Traffic

An analysis of traffic flow within single and double lane systems using a discrete automation model is carried out below. Road density dependant optimum speed limits are successfully estimated for these circular road systems of 22mph to 56mph. The improvement in flow when going from the single to double lane models
was also inspected and found to be a factor of 1.92 to 1.65 greater, dependant on road speed limit. Finally, a ’funnelling lane’ style model was then explored which was seen to have an equilibrium density which changed with speed limit. Within this file:
